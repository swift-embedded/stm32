This is an Custom Class example that demonstrates WinUSB Class
on USB Device.

The example demonstrates a WinUSB device that contains Bulk IN and 
Bulk OUT endpoints, everything that device receives on Bulk OUT 
endpoint it echoes back on Bulk IN endpoint.

Board:                  Keil  'MCBSTM32F400'
Microcontroller:        ST       'STM32F407'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 168 MHz
                        USB FS CLK =  48 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  60 MHz (from external ULPI PHY)

After device is connected on Win8 and later, device driver will be 
installed automatically. On Win7 user has to select driver file can 
be found in project folder.
After device is installed in Windows it can be tested by PC application 
WinUSB_Test (.\ARM\Utilities\WinUSB_Test\Release\WinUSB_Test.exe).

Note: The GUID that is used in Windows to access the device is configured 
in 3 places. First place it is configured on the device in USBD_Config_n.c 
file. Second place it is configured in mcbstm32f400-winusb_echo.inf 
driver information file.
Third place it is configured is in WinUSB_Test PC application.
To generate unique GUID follow the procedure described on the following 
web page: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms241442(v=vs.80).aspx

The program is available for target(s):
- Debug:
  - Compiler optimization Level 1
  - Debug USB library
  - Enabled Event Recorder
- Release:
  - Compiler optimization Level 3
  - Release USB library

Driver Files:
-------------
  - mcbstm32f400-winusb_echo.inf       : Driver setup information.
  - mcbstm32f400-winusb_echo_x86.cat   : Digitally signed driver catalog file for
                                         32-bit Host PCs.
  - mcbstm32f400-winusb_echo_amd64.cat : Digitally signed driver catalog file for
                                         64-bit Host PCs.

Note : Digitally signing of the driver catalog file is required to install
drivers on 64-bit PCs using Windows Vista or later Windows versions. Please
refer to Microsoft documentation for further information.

Driver Installation:
--------------------
If Windows PC is connected to Internet and if in Device Installation Settings 
(Start->Devices and Printers-right mouse click on Computer icon->Device Installation Settings)
appropriate setting is selected (any except Never install driver software from Windows Update)
for high-speed device driver will install automatically.
For full-speed device or if driver isn't installed automatically, you should go to 
Start->Devices and Printers-right mouse click on new device->Properties->Hardware
->Properties->Update Driver->Browse my computer for driver software
then navigate to <project folder> and click on Next
