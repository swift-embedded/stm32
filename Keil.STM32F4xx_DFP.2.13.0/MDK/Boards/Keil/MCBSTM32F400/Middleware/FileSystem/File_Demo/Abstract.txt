This is a File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy and delete files on any enabled
drive (SD/MMC Card, NOR/NAND Flash) and format each drive.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/FileSystem/html/fs_examples.html#fs_standalone_example

The File_Demo program is a standalone application preconfigured for
Keil MCBSTM32F400 Board using ULink2 Debugger and ITM debug
port as a communication interface.

You can test it from uVision Debug Session:
  Start Debug session (Ctrl + F5) and open Debug (printf)
  Viewer (View->Serial Windows->Debug (printf) Viewer).

Application is loaded into on-chip flash and is available 
for following targets:
- Debug:
  - Compiler optimization Level 1
  - Debug File System library
  - Enabled Event Recorder
- Release:
  - Compiler optimization Level 3
  - Release File System library

Jumper Settings:
    Memory Bus address lines A19, A20 and A21 are shared with TRACE
    lines. Jumpers J10, J11 and J12 should select address lines to
    enable NOR drive functionality.

Note:
  - Flash prefetch accelerator should be disabled if the example
    experiences functionality issues when using STM32F407 device
    revision A. Please, refer to http://www.keil.com/support/docs/3640.htm

  - M29W640FB Flash driver base address is at 0x60000000.
