This program is a BSD_Client example running on Network Dual Stack.
It is used to send commands to a BSD_Server or LEDSwitch server
connected on the same LAN.

In order to run this example, you need to use auto-assigned IPv6 address
or set IPv4 address to match your local area network.

To test this example, you need also a server application to connect to.
Download and run a BSD_Server or LEDSwitch server on a different evaluation
board connected to the same LAN. When BSD_Client is running, LED diodes on
both evaluation boards should light in sync.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addresses on BSD_Server.

The BSD_Client program is a standalone application preconfigured for
MCBSTM32F400 Evaluation Board.

Application is loaded into on-chip flash and is available 
for following targets:
- Debug:
  - Compiler optimization Level 1
  - Debug Network library
  - Enabled Event Recorder
- Release:
  - Compiler optimization Level 3
  - Release Network library

Note:
  - MCBSTM32F400 V1.2: KSZ8081RNA Ethernet PHY is populated.
                       KSZ8081RNA CMSIS-Driver Ethernet PHY is preselected.

  - MCBSTM32F400 V1.1: ST802RT1 Ethernet PHY is populated.
                       Change selection of CMSIS-Driver Ethernet PHY in
                       the Run-Time Environment window to ST802RT1.
