This is a Telnet_Server example running on Network Dual Stack.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/Network/html/_telnet__example.html

Use this example to connect an evaluation board to a LAN with router.
You may also connect an evaluation board to PC directly using a direct
or crosslink network cable.
To connect to the telnet server you can use auto-assigned IPv6 address,
IPv4 address assigned by the DHCP server or NBNS resolved local host name.

To test this example, run a telnet client on your PC. If you are using
Windows telnet client, you can connect using the following command in
the console window:

> telnet mcbstm32f400  or
> telnet <ip4 address> or
> telnet <ip6 address>

IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are printed on display of evaluation board.

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

Type 'help' to see the available commands or 'bye' to disconnect.

The Telnet_Server program is a standalone application preconfigured for
