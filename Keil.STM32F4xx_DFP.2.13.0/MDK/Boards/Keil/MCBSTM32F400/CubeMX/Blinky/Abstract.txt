The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32F407' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32F400' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          168.00 MHz

 - LEDs are blinking as running light
 - blinking speed depends on potentiometer position
 - blinking is paused while holding down the USER button

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Enabled Event Recorder
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Source'
 - Release:
   - Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Library'
