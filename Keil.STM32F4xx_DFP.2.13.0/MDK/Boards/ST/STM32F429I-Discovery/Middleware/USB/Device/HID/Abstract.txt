This is an HID example that demonstrates Human Interface Device (HID)
on USB Device.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/USB/html/dev_hid_tutorial.html

Board:                  ST 'STM32F429I-Discovery'
Microcontroller:        ST 'STM32F429ZI'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =   8 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 168 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  48 MHz
User Interface          inputs:  USER button
                        outputs: PB13 and PG14 LED

The example demonstrates a Human Interface Device. The board LEDs and 
push buttons can be accessed from the PC through a custom 
HID Client Program (.\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release\HIDClient.exe).

The program is available for target(s):
- Debug:
  - Compiler optimization Level 1
  - Debug USB library
  - Enabled Event Recorder
- Release:
  - Compiler optimization Level 3
  - Release USB library
